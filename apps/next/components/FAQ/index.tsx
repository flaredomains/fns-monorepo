    subText:
      'Because the FNS contracts only deal with hashes internally, they do not enforce limits on what can be registered. However, any resolvers such as browsers and wallets should apply the same nameprep algorithm to any names a user enters before resolving. As a result, names that are not valid outputs of nameprep will not be resolvable by the standard PublicResolver, making them useless.',

After the grace period, the name is released for registration by anyone with a temporary premium which decreases over a 21 days period. The released name continues to resolve your ETH address until the new owner overwrites it.`,

    text: 'Can I use an FNS name to point to my website?',
    subText: `Though FNS can technically store anything, there aren't many third party tools and applications which resolve IP addresses attached to FNS.
    Instead, we suggest hosting your static html/css/images on IPFS and put the hash in your FNS name's Content record. Then it can be resolved by FNS-aware browsers (e.g. Opera), browser extensions (Metamask), or any browser with ".link" or ".limo" appended to the end (e.g. matoken.eth.link or matoken.eth.limo).
    If you want to redirect your FNS name to an existing website, you could write a html file containing JavaScript logic to redirect to your website, upload the file into ipfs using services like IPFS Pinata, then set the CID to your contenthash. See the source code of depositcontract.eth.limo as an example.`,

    text: 'What is the difference between the Registrant and Controller?',
    subText: `If your Flare address is set as the Controller you can change the resolver and add/edit records. Some dapps (eg: Fleek, OpenSea) set themselves as the Controller so they can update records on your behalf.
    The Registrant only exists on ".flr" names and it allows you to change the Controller. If you transfer the Registrant to an address you don't own, you lose the ownership of the name.`,

    text: 'What is a Primary FNS Name record?',
    subText: `A Primary FNS Name record (formerly Reverse Record) makes your Flare address point to an FNS name. This allows dapps to find and display your FNS name when you connect to them with your Flare account. This can only be set by you so it is not set automatically upon registration.
    To set the Primary FNS Name record, please click "My account", and select "Primary FNS Name".`,

  {
    text: 'Why are some of my subdomains shown as a jumble of characters?',
    subText: `FNS names are stored as a hash on-chain so we have to decode the name using a list of possible names, and it shows in the hashed format if we don't have it on our list. You can still access and manage the name if you search for the name directly in the search bar.`,
